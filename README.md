## Analysis Summary of School Data


## Analysis Conclusions
1. Charter High Schools have better math and reading scores, showing higher passing rates than District High Schools overall
    One thing to note is the type_summary chart, showcasing the two different types of schools avaiable. There are district schools and charter schools that make up the 15 schools in the area. Based on the chart alone, Charter schools outpace the student data from the District schools. To put it into perspective, the average overall passing percentage for Charger schools is hovering just over 90%, while the overall passing percentage for District schools reaches just below 54%. 
2. Overall passing rates are higher when schools tend to be smaller in size.
    Looking at school types alone, we can see that like our conclusion earlier, Charger schools on average have higher math and reading scores and have higher passing rates. One factor that may have an impact on this is the number of students each school has. We see in our size_summary chart that the data point towards smaller and medium sized schools having the higher average test scores and % passing rates. It would also be wise to note that the overall passing rates are nearly halfed as the population size of the student body increase. Why could that be? Some factors that we would need to do more research on are how the funds are being used and how many students there are per teacher. Based on our per_school summary, the budget per school appeared to be large, but after factoring in the amount of students, each of the 15 schools were nearly evenly matched for budget per student, ranging from as low as $578 to as high as $655. In some cases, one school would be getting a higher amount of budget per student with less student body versus a school with a higher student body count, but lower budget per student. Finances takes a big hit on resource availability for these students, and while our data cannot speak upon that, it would be the next course of action in order to better understand these 15 schools.
